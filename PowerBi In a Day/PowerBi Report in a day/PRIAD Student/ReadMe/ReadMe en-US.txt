SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================

1. Extract the PowerBIPRIAD-Student.zip file locally to your PC (Windows 7, or later).
2. Open the file properties of the zip file, and check "unblock" (Windows may flag the file as potentially untrusted).
3. Create a root course folder. We recommend you name it something like "C:\Training". Remember this location, because you'll need to access the course files during the labs. All lab documents refer to this location as <CourseFolder>.
4. Extract the PowerBIPRIAD-Student.zip file contents to your root course folder.

Once extracted, you'll have the PowerBIPRIAD folder, and within it you'll find the following folders:

- Lab01A (and all other lab folders). Each lab folder contains the lab document and resources, which may include assets and solution files.
- MySolution: This folder stores your solution files. The lab instructions will direct you when to use it.
- Presentation: This folder contains the course presentation file, which is available as a PDF document.

GET STARTED
===========

When you're ready to commence the first lab, open the <CourseFolder>\PowerBIPRIAD\Lab01A\PowerBIPRIAD_Lab01A.pdf file (or localized file). This document guides you to sign in to the Power BI service, upload a Power BI Desktop file, and then install Power BI Report Builder.

NOTE
====

You're responsible for having your own Power BI account. If you don't already have one, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi

You must sign in to Power BI to publish a Power BI Desktop file to a workspace. The publication results in a dataset that's used as a report data source. You don't need a Power BI Pro license or a Power BI Premium subscription to use a dataset as a report data source.

Some lab tasks involve publishing your paginated report to a workspace. You can only open a paginated report when it's been saved to a workspace on dedicated capacity, which has the paginated reports workload enabled. If you don't have access to a suitable workspace, the lab will provide you with a link to watch a video that demonstrates report publication instead.
